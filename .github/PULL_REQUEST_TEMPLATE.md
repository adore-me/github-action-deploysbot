**NOTES:**

- after merge a version bump will occur and a new release will be created.
- version bump will only apply if you modify the `.github/workflows` directory (except `release.yaml`).
- by default the versioning is configured to bump the `patch` version of the script.

âš  If you need to bump the `major` or `minor` version you should label this `PR` with either one of:

- `release:major` 
- `release:minor`
